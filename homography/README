To run the program decompress the program and simply type 'make' in the 
terminal of the same directory.  All in the makefile is set up to take care
of all the compilations. 

Example of run: 
./homography < boxtop.in | ./hmap cheerios-small.ppm 500 650 > face.ppm

Above boxtop.in are the coordinates and cheerios-small.ppm is the original 
image to be transposed and the resulting ppm is face.ppm

This program takes an image as input and uses homography to transpose the 
angle of the image by running it through an LU decomposition with coordinates
given (as seen in boxtop.in).
