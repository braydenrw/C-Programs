Compile with the line "make test" in the terminal.  This command will also
run the LUtest.c file and give the error value of a specified 4x4, 5x5, 10x10
and 600x600 matrix.  

Input takes in a matrix and output gives a close estimate of the factored 
matrix.  It factors the matrix as a product of a lower triangular matrix
and an upper triangular matrix (LU).
